# Hi there 

I am a dedicated and detail-oriented mathematician with a Bachelor of Mathematical Sciences, specializing in applying advanced mathematical concepts and principles to solve complex real-world problems and optimize decision-making processes. Through a comprehensive data science bootcamp, I have gained hands-on experience in Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn to analyze and interpret data effectively.

As a Junior Data Analyst, I am passionate about extracting insights from data and utilizing them to drive informed business decisions. My analytical skills and technical proficiency allow me to manipulate and visualize data, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions that enhance organizational performance.

In addition to my data analysis capabilities, I have experience as an Entry-Level IT Support Specialist, providing technical assistance and troubleshooting support to end-users. This role has honed my problem-solving skills and ability to communicate complex technical information clearly and effectively.

I am eager to contribute to a dynamic team where I can apply my skills and continue to grow in the field of data analysis.
